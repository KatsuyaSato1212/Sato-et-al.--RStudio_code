Here, we present the NGS and scRNA-seq analysis methods used in the paper titled 'Efficient Differentiation of Human iPSCs into Leydig-like Cells Capable of Long-term Stable Secretion of Testosterone'. 

First, install RStudio on your computer. (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Next, visit the NCBI GEO website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and download the datasets GSE244796, GSE112013, and GSE245553. 

Enter the code from 'Sato et al., RStudio_code.docx', available on GitHub, into RStudio and execute the analysis.
