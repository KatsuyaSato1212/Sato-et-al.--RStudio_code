Here, we present the NGS and scRNA-seq analysis methods used in the paper titled 'Efficient Differentiation of Human iPSCs into Leydig-like Cells Capable of Long-term Stable Secretion of Testosterone'. 

First, install RStudio on your computer. 

Next, visit the NCBI GEO website and download the datasets GSE244796, GSE112013, and GSE245553. 

Enter the code from 'Sato et al., RStudio_code.docx', available on GitHub, into RStudio and execute the analysis.
